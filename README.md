# tootlist

Terrible, terrible name, that started out as a way to replace my 8-track uploads, as https://8tracks.com/ is not as enjoyable as it once was. With that said, it was a great little project to dive more into Vuex and state management. Feels good to build something in my freetime too.

## TO DO
* Continuous playing while navigating different playlists
* Repeat all - Repeat mixtape
* Repeat one - Repeat single track
* Random - Randomize mixtape order
* â€œRadio mode" - This would be random list of all available tracks
* Permalinks for mixtapes - Basically implementing a router so it's easy to share.
